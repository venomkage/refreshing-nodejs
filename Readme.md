# So here's the story

### Years ago, maybe 3-4 I started with whole web dev thing. I learnt complete MERN stack but eventually I focused more and more into just frontend. First ReactJS then React-Native, Expo etc. Through the years I worked in frontend positions and I kept moving further from backend-dev. Now when I think front-end is getting a bit boring for me, I think it's the perfect time to dive deeper into backend stuff, especially, NodeJS, ExpressJS etc. 

### I am choosing JS based backend tech because I already have some experience in JS. Who knows as time passes, I might choose something else, Spring Boot or something. But as of now...NodeJS is fine.
