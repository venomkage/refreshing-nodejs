# So here's the story

Years ago, maybe 3-4 I started with whole web dev thing. I learnt complete MERN stack but eventually I focused more and more into just frontend. First ReactJS then React-Native, Expo etc. Through the years I worked in frontend positions and I kept moving further from backend-dev. Now when I think front-end is getting a bit boring for me, I think it's the perfect time to dive deeper into backend stuff, especially, NodeJS, ExpressJS etc. 

I am choosing JS based backend tech because I already have some experience in JS. Who knows as time passes, I might choose something else, Spring Boot or something. But as of now...NodeJS is fine.

## Update as of 27 July 2025
1. So, as of now. I have made complete app in ExpressJS with MySQL.
2. Deployed backend on AWS EC2. It means:
    <br/>
    2.1. Setting up the instance(installing OS and all).<br/>
    2.2. Connecting through SSH.<br/>
    2.3. Installing node and mysql on that instance.<br/>
    2.4. Transferring all file from local machine.<br/>
    2.5. Caddy and .service for letting the server always run.

## Further plans
1. Installing TypeScript
2. Maybe PostgreSQL, I don't know...let's see.
3. And, a domain of course. At this moment the IP serves the purpose well.
